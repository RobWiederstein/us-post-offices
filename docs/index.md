`US Post Offices` is a spatial-historical dataset containing records for 166,140 post offices that operated in the United States between 1639 and 2000. The dataset provides a year-by-year snapshot of the national postal system and its geography over multiple centuries, making it one of the most fine-grained and comprehensive spatial datasets assembled about US history:
